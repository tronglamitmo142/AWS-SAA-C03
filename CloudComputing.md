## 5 properties to consider 1 ecosystem is cloud 

1. Can provision capabilities as needed without requiring human interation   
2. Broad over network:  
   1. Can access from anywhere, any devices   
   2. Using standards network   
3. Resource pooling  
   1. Resource independent   
   2. Can use by multi-telnant model and each telnal isolated each other   
=> Easyly scale  
4. Rapid Elastic   
   1. Capabilities availble for provising often appear to be unlimited   
5. Measured service  
   1. Resource useage can be monitored, controlled, reported and **Billed**  

## Types of Cloud   
1. Public Cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure,...  
2. Private Cloud:   
   - Has 5 characteristics above   
   - Design for bussiness's demand   
3. Multicloud: Using multicloud environment   
4. Hybrid Cloud: Public Cloud + Private Cloud != Hybrid Environment (Public Cloud + On-Premise environment)  

## Cloud Services Model     

- Infrastructure Stack:       
![InfraStack](./images/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-04%20at%2014.04.17.png)    
- Unit of consumsion: Part we not manage => need to pay    
- Some types:    
  - DC Hosted: Provider provision **facilities** => need to pay for **facilities**     
  - IAAS: Infrastructure as a services (EC2):  
    - Provider manage: Facilities -> Virtualization   
  - PAAS:   
    - Useful for developer (just want runtime environment for application running, such as Heroku)  
    - Provide manage: Facilities -> Container  
  - SAAS (Software as a services): Netflix, email,...
